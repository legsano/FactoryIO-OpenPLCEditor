# FactoryIO-OpenPLCEditor

My college partners in working on this project : Alifian Putra, Desi Fitriana

This is a collection of mechatronics projects simulating building a factory and programming it using a PLC.

I programmed it using FactoryIO software for factory simulation, OpenPLCEditor for PLC programs and OpenPLC Runtime for local servers


Thanks
